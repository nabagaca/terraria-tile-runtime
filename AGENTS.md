# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Core framework code lives in `src/Core` (`TerrariaModder.Core.csproj`). Each mod is a separate project under `src/<ModName>/` with:
- `<ModName>.csproj`
- `Mod.cs`
- `manifest.json`
- optional supporting classes/assets

Use `templates/ModTemplate/` when creating a new mod. Documentation source is in `docs/`, built via `mkdocs.yml`. Build outputs go to `build/core/` (core DLL) and `build/plugins/` (mod DLLs).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run from repo root:

```powershell
# Build core
dotnet build src/Core/TerrariaModder.Core.csproj -c Release

# Build one mod
dotnet build src/StorageHub/StorageHub.csproj -c Release

# Build all projects under src/
Get-ChildItem src -Recurse -Filter *.csproj | ForEach-Object { dotnet build $_.FullName -c Release }
```

Docs commands:

```powershell
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve   # local docs preview
mkdocs build   # CI-equivalent static build
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
This repo is C# (`net48`, `LangVersion=latest`) with Allman braces and 4-space indentation. Follow existing naming patterns:
- `PascalCase` for types/methods/properties
- `_camelCase` for private fields
- descriptive file names matching primary types

For manifests, keep `id` lowercase kebab-case (example: `quick-keys`) and align `entry_dll` with the assembly name.

## Testing Guidelines
There is currently no dedicated automated test project. Validate changes with manual smoke tests in Terraria 1.4.5:
1. Build the affected project(s).
2. Copy DLL + `manifest.json` to `Terraria/TerrariaModder/mods/<mod-id>/`.
3. Launch via `TerrariaInjector.exe`.
4. Verify feature behavior and check logs for errors.

When adding pure logic components, prefer introducing small unit-testable classes and (if feasible) a `tests/` project.

## Inspecting Terraria Classes (Reflection & Decompilation)
When behavior is unclear, inspect Terraria internals before implementing hooks or patches.

- Prefer decompilation first for API discovery:
  - Open `Terraria.exe` (and related game assemblies) in ILSpy or dnSpy.
  - Confirm type names, namespaces, member signatures, visibility, and call flow.
  - Check for version-specific differences before relying on any method/field.
- Use runtime reflection to verify assumptions in the live game process:
  - Query `Type.GetType(...)`/`Assembly.GetType(...)` and log resolved members.
  - Use `BindingFlags` explicitly (`Public`/`NonPublic`, `Instance`/`Static`) when probing fields or methods.
  - Add null checks and defensive guards so missing members fail gracefully with clear logs.
- Cross-check decompiled findings with runtime behavior:
  - Validate invocation timing (for example, update loop vs draw loop) and side effects.
  - Confirm argument/state expectations with targeted debug logging.
- Keep inspection utilities isolated:
  - Put temporary reflection probes behind debug flags and remove them before release.
  - Do not commit one-off dump scripts/log spam unless they are intentionally reusable tooling.
- Document non-obvious discoveries:
  - For any fragile/private API dependency, add a brief code comment describing the inspected member and expected Terraria version.
  - Include reproduction notes in PRs when a fix depends on decompiled or reflected internals.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history is mostly release-style commits (for example, `v0.1.0`). For normal development commits, use clear, scoped messages (example: `StorageHub: fix recursive craft refresh`).

PRs should include:
- concise summary of behavior changes
- affected mod(s)/paths
- manual test steps performed
- screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
- docs updates when APIs, manifests, or user workflows change
